        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Mental health/wellness is about more than the absence of mental
          illness. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, mental
          health is “the capacity of each and all of us to feel, think, and act
          in ways that enhance our ability to enjoy life and deal with the
          challenges we face.” Our mental health/wellness allows us to realize
          our potential, cope with stress effectively, bounce back from life
          challenges and be active, productive members of our communities. How
          each of us defines our mental health/wellness can be very different
          and quite individualized. It is important to keep in mind, that good
          mental health/wellness is not about avoiding problems or having the
          perfect life. Rather, it is about living well and feeling capable
          despite life’s challenges. Our mental health and our capacity to
          maintain our mental wellness is based on many factors. Lifestyles that
          incorporate a holistic approach that focus on our physical, spiritual,
          emotional, social and intellectual health, place us in the best
          position to live a healthy, mentally well, life.
